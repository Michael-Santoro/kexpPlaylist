6,Expansions,3,"Expansions began in late 1995 as the brainchild of Riz Rollins as a response to the burgeoning acid jazz scene that was enjoying popularity in local clubs, but underexposed on the local airwaves. Even at its inception it has always been important that the show not be commanded by any monolithic style or single host, but has always enjoyed 3 hosts who bring a variety of influences and style to the final mix. An Expansions mix will include old and new releases in its mix in a variety of genres. An Expansions mix can included trip-hop, chill, ambient, drum and bass, house, dub, electronica, jazz, sometimes world music, sometimes rock, sometimes....well sometimes even the most disparate elements come together thanks to the expert curator efforts of its current hosts Kid Hops, Masa, and Riz. \n\n-DJ Riz",Electronic,True

8,Jazz Theatre,4,"I have a personal mission statement in mind for Jazz Theater. That is, to really celebrate the fact that Jazz Is Alive and Thriving. Now! \n\nIn recent years, jazz has been cast in an unfortunate historical context -- as something that already happened, and is now over. Or, individual ""experts"" are too willing to narrowly define jazz - like; it sounds like this, and like that, and like this -- and if it doesn't, it isn't jazz. \n\nI think instead, that jazz, like any vibrant art form, has a mandate to expand and recreate itself -- to try new things, to get better, or at least to be different today than it was yesterday. Certainly jazz has a rich history. But part of that history is expansion and progression. Jazz never has stood still for long, there's no reason to think is should now. \n\nIn programming Jazz Theater I look for compelling work by artists who have been willing to blaze new trails. Clearly they have all studied the history of jazz, and thankfully they are not willing to be confined by it. Some of Jazz Theater will be familiar and, hopefully, some of it will be like nothing you've ever heard before. \n\n-John Gilbreath",Jazz,True

17,Preachin' the Blues,8,"From out of the swamp and through the woods comes the Preachin' the Blues show. Every Sunday I explore the downhome, uptown and gospel sounds of rhythm and blues music, and the focus is always on the most soulful, gritty, heartfelt and creative artists and material. \n\nCountry blues gets a special spotlight in the early morning, but quite often we move into the church for some old time singing, powerful preaching and funky accompaniment. \n\nI am a fan of southern soul and I always include something from my collection of Stax and Hi stuff in the mix, but the deep blues are firmly represented in each show with heaping helpings of the three Kings of the blues guitar, the rich character of Chicago's legends, and always a certain amount of Louisiana's magickal mystique. \n\n-Johnny Horn","Blues,Country,Roots",True
18,Seek & Destroy,9,"Tanner Ellison : Host, DJ, and Producer of Seek & Destroy, Saturday Nights at Midnight to 2AM<br /><br /> Tanner Ellison is a professional artist living and working in Seattle. He has been corrupted by metal since he was a little grub. He had an unlikely start in radio around the age of 12 or 13 when he had a local mechanic build a FM transmitter for trade and started his hometowns only pirate radio station. Running a pirate radio station with his hooligan friends eventually led to writing and playing music. Tanner played guitar and screeched in many terrible punk and metal bands over the years. After moving to Seattle, he guest DJ'ed for KEXP's Sonic Reducer as well as several venues and events.<br /><br /> Tanner has sought out every blackened forest and gruesome abbitoir of the underground extreme metal world seeking incredible music. He grew up loving everything from old school death metal to the most atmospheric, ethereal black metal to haunt the the Pacific Northwest. Tanner has a rabid affection for listening to records and tapes and plays mostly vinyl every week on Seek & Destroy to ensure the best possible sound quality for listeners.<br /><br /> When not sharpening battle axes and hanging out in spooky caves, he sculpts and models undead soldiers from beyond the void and draws pictures of dragons and space wizards. He is currently a Senior Production Artist at HBO making all kinds of rad stuff.<br /><br /> Facebook - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/SeekAndDestroyOnKEXP"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/SeekAndDestroyOnKEXP</a><br />Instagram - <a href=""https://instagram.com/seekanddestroy_kexp"" target=""_blank"">https://instagram.com/seekanddestroy_kexp</a>","Metal,Rock",True

20,Sonarchy,10,"Sonarchy Radio is a live performance broadcast that is a showcase for the many northwest artists who are pushing the limits of their music. Each week Jack Straw Productions in Seattle's University District hooks up it's non-profit recording studio to KEXP and sets the stage for you to sit in the middle of unique performance. \n\nI've been a recording engineer and producer in Seattle since 1985 and am mighty pleased to be able to produce this show. Since our first broadcast in 1996 the goal of giving artists a full hour to make their work happen has been quite successful. In fact the only thing to have changed over time is that I'm listening to an increasingly broader range of new music and sound art to consider for broadcasts. \n\nSonarchy Radio is currently featuring a huge diversity of talent working in the outer limits of jazz, composition, noise, beats, sound art and improvisation. Listen for small acoustic ensembles and crack improv groups to 120 db laptop collectives and those large, electric funky beat sessions that Seattle is famous for. I think you may be amazed at what is happening in Seattle. As I do the live mix each week I'm thrilled to be a part of such a diverse and vibrant scene. My association with KEXP and Jack Straw Productions is equally as satisfying. \n\nLook for sonarchy radio performances released by the artists and various labels. To date dozens of titles have been released and are a good indication that the music is really happening. For more detailed information on Sonarchy Radio, including how to get your work on the show, visit the Jack Straw website. More information about my work in the studio is at doughaire.com.

25,Swingin' Doors,13,"Swingin' Doors is dedicated to a wide range of country sounds and styles, from honky tonk and western swing to alternative country and bluegrass, in sharp contrast to the tight playlists and narrow focus of today's commercial country radio. \n\nAs might be expected from a show named Swingin' Doors, there's usually a bit more honky tonk than anything else, though you'll hear everything from old-time fiddle tunes and boppin' country boogie to lush Countrypolitan sounds and hard-charging alternative twang-rock. \n\nYou'll hear country giants like Loretta Lynn, Ernest Tubb and Lefty Frizzell alongside more obscure but talented folks such as Joe Carson, the Lonesome Pine Fiddlers and Charline Arthur. You'll also hear plenty of new music ranging from hardcore honky tonkers like Roger Wallace and Heather Myles to edgy alt-country artists like Neko Case, the Drive-By Truckers and Fred Eaglesmith. \n\nI try to keep listeners up-to-date with what's happening now in the wide world of country music, while also bringing to light the richness and diversity of country's past. I'll also do my best to put the music in context by structuring the show so you can see the connections between different songs, artists and styles, along with sharing anecdotes and other bits of information about the music. \n\nI also try to give folks a chance to hear country artists that are coming to town soon, while also supporting Seattle's twang community by regularly playing the music of local artists. \n\nMore than anything else, I try to play music that moves you, whether it's a song that makes you jump with joy or one that rips your heart out. \n\n-Don Slack","Blues,Country,Roots",True

30,The Roadhouse,23,"The Roadhouse is a roots program emphasizing the blues and other traditional styles of American music. The show presents the wide and wonderful spectrum of our musical legacy - the roots of todays popular music and culture. The show explores regional differences in American recordings with a decidely Southern bent. \n\nAs a programmer/producer, my goal is to create a mix of American music that transcends simple definitions and catergories of style. I play blues, but also country blues, piano blues, folk blues, zydeco, punk blues and whatever new interpretations come along. I play country and folk, but also old-time mountain music, bluegrass, singer/songwriters, cajun, folk/country rock, and any revival that comes next. In addition, the show recogonizes the importance of the church in the developement of popular American music - gospel spirituals laid a foundation for bluegrass, rhythm and blues and soul music. I try to play the new with the old, and the known next to the unknown. \n\nUltimately, I hope the show is an alternative to what's known as ""American roots"" or any ""boomer"" definition of roots-rock turns classic-rock. I play a mix which hopefully turns the familiar fresh and demostrates that we always return to the source - it's just one music eventually. \n\n-Greg Vandy","Blues,Country,Roots",True
